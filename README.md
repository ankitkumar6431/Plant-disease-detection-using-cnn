# Plant-disease-detection-using-cnn
This project focuses on the early detection of plant diseases using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to develop a model that can analyze leaf images and accurately identify signs of diseases at their initial stages, enabling timely intervention and reducing crop loss.

By training a CNN on a labeled dataset of healthy and diseased plant leaves, the model learns to extract and classify visual features such as discoloration, spots, or texture changes that indicate potential infections. The system is designed to be robust, scalable, and usable via a simple web or mobile interface, allowing farmers or agricultural professionals to upload images and receive instant diagnostic
